Cleaning Everything in 30 Minutes

1Clean your bathroom. Clear everything off of your sink, toilet and the ledge of your bathtub. Spray these areas down with your cleaning product of choice and then give each area a quick scrub. Return everything you moved back to your sink, toilet, and tub. Grab any dirty linens and throw them directly in the washing machine or laundry hamper.[1]

2Clean your bedroom. Concentrate on making your bed; once your bed is made, your whole room will look far tidier. Pick up loose clothes and shoes and return them to their rightful places. If you have dirty dishes lying around, return those to the kitchen.[2] [3]
•	Allocate five minutes to clean your bedroom.
•	Save time off your bed making by leaving the flat sheet untucked - hospital corners take a long time to construct and your comforter will cover them anyway,[4]
•	Open windows as you go to eliminate odors and get a nice cross-breeze going.
